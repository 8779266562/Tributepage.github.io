                Acentral figure in the “green revolution”, Norman Ernest Borlaug (born March 25, 1914)
                was born on a farm near Cresco, Iowa, to Henry and Clara Borlaug. For the past twenty-seven
                years he has collaborated with Mexican scientists on problems of wheat improvement; for the
                last ten or so of those years he has also collaborated with scientists from other parts of the world,
                especially from India and Pakistan, in adapting the new wheats to new lands and in gaining acceptance
                for their production.
                An eclectic, pragmatic, goal-oriented scientist, he accepts and discards methods or results in a
                constant search for more
                fruitful and effective ones, while at the same time avoiding the pursuit of what he calls “academic
                butterflies”.
                A vigorous man who can perform prodigies of manual labor in the fields, he brings to his work the body
                and competitive
                spirit of the trained athlete, which indeed he was in his high school and college days.</p>

                After completing his primary and secondary education in Cresco, Borlaug enrolled in the University of
                Minnesota where he studied forestry.
                Immediately before and immediately after receiving his Bachelor of Science degree in 1937, he worked for
                the U.S.
                Forestry Service at stations in Massachusetts and Idaho. Returning to the University of Minnesota to
                study plant pathology, he received the master’s degree in 1939
                and the doctorate in 1942</p>

                From 1942 to 1944, he was a microbiologist on the staff of the du Pont de Nemours Foundation where he
                was in charge of research on
                industrial and agricultural bactericides, fungicides, and preservatives.</p>

            <p>In 1944 he accepted an appointment as geneticist and plant pathologist assigned the task of organizing
                and directing the
                Cooperative Wheat Research and Production Program in Mexico. This program, a joint undertaking by the
                Mexican government and the
                Rockefeller Foundation, involved scientific research in genetics, plant breeding, plant pathology,
                entomology, agronomy, soil science,
                and cereal technology. Within twenty years he was spectacularly successful in finding a high-yielding
                short-strawed, disease-resistant wheat.</p>

        <center>
            <p>To his scientific goal he soon added that of the practical humanitarian: arranging to put the new cereal
                strains
                into extensive production in order to feed the hungry people of the world – and thus providing, as he
                says,
                “a temporary success in man’s war against hunger and deprivation,” a breathing space in which to deal
                with the “Population Monster”
                and the subsequent environmental and social ills that too often lead to conflict between men and between
                nations. Statistics on the
                vast acreage planted with the new wheat and on the revolutionary yields harvested in Mexico, India, and
                Pakistan are given in the presentation speech by Mrs. Lionaes and in the Nobel lecture by Dr. Borlaug.
                Well advanced, also, is the use of the new wheat in six Latin American countries, six in the Near and
                Middle East, several in Africa.</p>
